# Green Machine
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

 For my first milestone, I managed to get the RC movement mechanism of the tank working. I used an Arduino to control the robot. The 2 DC motors are controlled by the L298N motor controller. The whole robot is controlled via an app I made. The app conveys the instructions to the Bluetooth module which transmits the info to the Arduino. The Arduino sends the signal to the motor controller which controls the DC motor. I enjoyed learning how to code and build the app. I also enjoyed soldering all the connections. I struggled with getting the Bluetooth module to work. It often stopped working. For my next milestone, I will be adding the watering mechanism.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was a motor powered by a motor controller. It was controlled via an Arduino. A motion sensor gave the input for when to move. For example when I moved my hand in front of the sensor, the motor spun for 5 seconds and stopped. I wasted a lot of time troublehshooting because the motor controller turned out to be dead. I enjoyed testing and coding it. I look forward to my intensive project.
